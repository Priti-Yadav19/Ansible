Run Instructions : Install Ansible Using Python VirtualEnv
Install Ansible

1. Verify Python3 is installed.
python3 --version
apt install python3-pip

2. If Missing Install python3
sudo apt update
sudo apt install software-properties-common
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3.8
sudo apt install python3-pip
python3 --version


3. Install Dependencies
sudo apt-get install python3-minimal python3-virtualenv python3-dev build-essential


4. Set up virtualenv
mkdir ansible
cd ansible
virtualenv myansible


5. Activate Virtual Env
source myansible/bin/activate


6. Install Ansible
pip3 install ansible


7. Verify Ansible version
ansible --version

8. To come out of virtual env: Use command : deactivate

9. Configure ansible: ./ansible.cfg in current directory:
touch ./ansible.cfg   (./ menas in the current directory)
Note: This is the preffered way as it is limited to our virtual environment, 
its not outside the scope of virtual environment we created .
vi ansible.cfg
[defaults]
inventory = hosts

10. Whenever we are installing ansible using PIP we need to create the hosts file manually 
at virtual env location.
vi hosts
[all] 

11. To setup the communication between ansible controller and clients.
exit out of virtual env, perform below on controller:
ssh-keygen -t rsa   (to generate public and private key)
cd .ssh

Upload public key on aws:
go to console> key pairs > import keypair > paste the public key created on controller
This is the passwordless authentication and prferred industry standard way

Create nodes on AWS (launch EC2 instances)
- allow ssh rule 
ssh ec2-user@<public_ip/DNS>
- check for python must be installed on nodes(clients)
which python3
python3 --vrsion
which python
python --version

- Provide clients IP/FQDN in inventory file of Ansible
- Sample test to verify configuration:
ansible all -m ping
If command status is successful, means connection has established successfully.

- Edit hosts file:
vi hosts
[all]
ec2-user@<public_ip_node1>
ec2-user@<public_ip_node2>

ansible all -m ping

Basic commands:
ll | grep python
rm -rf python*
